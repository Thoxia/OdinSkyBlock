# What is OdinSkyBlock?
OdinSkyBlock is a open-sourced SkyBlock plugin.<br>
Okay, cool, but what does it offer? Why should I use OdinSkyBlock?<br>
OdinSkyBlock was actually made for Cross-Server (or Multi-Server, whatever you call it) use.<br>
With use of our amazing Multi-Server module, everything will be synced between servers.<br>
Provides players a seamless experience.<br>
More to come.

That does not mean you can't use OdinSkyBlock on a Single-Server setup!<br>
Plugin works without any issues on Single-Server setups as well, it's just not the main point of this project.<br>
Feel free to use this project in your single-server setups!

# Why Open-Source?
Well... why not? (also it's a good project for my portfolio :p)<br><br>
However, this does not mean you will get support when using the plugin without a valid subscription.<br>
Support will be given to customers and donors only.<br>
Please consider buying or donating, so I can actually keep this project going.<br><br>
(Modules provided by us are also open-sourced and can be found on our GitHub page.)<br>
**(We will provide support until the public beta ends.)**<br>

More information will be given in the future. :)
